/*
*Create annotation Review with two string elements: reviewer and date.
Element date has default string value today.
This annotation can be applied to class when we execute static method review(String className)
*  of class Util and the result of this method will be printed Class <ClassName>
was reviewed <date in format yyyy-mm-dd> by <reviewer> to standard output (console).
If the class <className> isnâ€™t annotated we show message: Class <ClassName> isn't marked as Reviewed.
If the class was not found we show message: Class <ClassName> was not found.
